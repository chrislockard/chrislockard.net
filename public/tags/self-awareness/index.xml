      <description>Recently, I celebrated a birthday. Typically, this is a joyous time, and I have many things to be grateful for. However, this birthday comes during a difficult year. As my wife and I were discussing this the other day, I realized that life can be a lot like the Atari game &amp;lsquo;Asteroids&amp;rsquo;.
   Atari Asteroids
