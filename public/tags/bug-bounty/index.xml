      <description>Nearly a year ago, I wrote about an emerging trend I observed with some of the bounty researchers I was interacting with. This screed can be considered an extension of that article.
There an emerging trend I&amp;rsquo;m noticing - I&amp;rsquo;ve been receiving more messages like the following:
 Hey , I found Security Vulnerability in your web application ,which can damage site as well as users too.For security purpose can we report vulnerability here,then will i get bounty bounty reward in PayPal or Bitcoin for Security bug ?</description>

      <title>A Lesson for Bug Bounty Researchers</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m managing a bug bounty program that has shown tremendous benefit so far. Several findings have been extremely clever, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to have good interactions with the vulnerability researchers. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve also had a few unsatisfactory interactions with researchers. This post is directed at Bug Bounty researchers that do not have much experience in corporate environments. I think a list of do&amp;rsquo;s and don&amp;rsquo;ts is appropriate for this breakdown.</description>
