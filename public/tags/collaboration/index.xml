      <description>This post was inspired by a client who came to me and said &amp;ldquo;I do not understand all of these findings, can you explain them to me?&amp;rdquo;, referring to my web application penetration test deliverable. We spoke for an hour, as I described the findings to him. I corrected him when his understanding was shaky, and I confirmed where his understanding was solid. He had a development background, and was studying for a security certification, but he was managing a large security project for a well-known company and I was surprised to learn he was a security newbie.</description>
