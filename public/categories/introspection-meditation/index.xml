      <description>Recently, work hosted an event designed to bring my team closer together. Using the Surepeople PRISM, we spent the morning discussing our dominant psychological traits and how we can use them to better interact as a team. I thought the exercise was brilliant, and it led me to seek out other tools to broaden my self awareness.
The first such tool I uncovered was the Johari Window.
  Johari Window   My ultimate self awareness goal is to shrink the &amp;ldquo;Blind Spot&amp;rdquo; window as much as possible.</description>

      <description>Recently, I celebrated a birthday. Typically, this is a joyous time, and I have many things to be grateful for. However, this birthday comes during a difficult year. As my wife and I were discussing this the other day, I realized that life can be a lot like the Atari game &amp;lsquo;Asteroids&amp;rsquo;.
   Atari Asteroids
You, as the ship, must be able to re-orient and overcome challenges (blast asteroids) frequently and rapidly.</description>

      <description>This post was inspired by a client who came to me and said &amp;ldquo;I do not understand all of these findings, can you explain them to me?&amp;rdquo;, referring to my web application penetration test deliverable. We spoke for an hour, as I described the findings to him. I corrected him when his understanding was shaky, and I confirmed where his understanding was solid. He had a development background, and was studying for a security certification, but he was managing a large security project for a well-known company and I was surprised to learn he was a security newbie.</description>
