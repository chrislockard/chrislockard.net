      <title>Blacklight Privacy Tool</title>

      <description>Today on my Mastodon feed, several folks were discussing a new tool by TheMarkup called Blacklight. This tool is billed as a &amp;ldquo;real-time website privacy inspector&amp;rdquo; that showcases the ad and tracking tech deployed by a website.
I shared this tool with several colleagues and it engendered a stimulating conversation surrounding company commitment to privacy. I argued during this conversation that it would be worse for a company to claim to value customer privacy and then have Blacklight reveal otherwise, than to have made no such claim in the first place.</description>

      <description>The fresh new look of this site is provided by the Academic Hugo Theme. Because I value your privacy just as I value my own, I needed to modify this theme to not make use of Google Web Fonts because use of this service enables Google to further track users.
In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll add the Montserrat font by Julieta Ulanovsky as the heading font for this blog:

      <title>Hands on with Brave Browser</title>
      <link>https://www.chrislockard.net/posts/brave-browser/</link>

      <description>Brave, the new Firefox? I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Brave browser as my full-time web browser for two weeks now, primarily version 0.21.18. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to tell the software is not yet at version 1.0, and although I&amp;rsquo;m not ready for this to replace Vivaldi, I really want it to.
Brave is fast. Really fast. It has built-in adblocking and anti-fingerprinting technology. Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve relied on uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger for adblocking and anti-fingerprinting.</description>

      <title>Apple VS FBI</title>

      <description>Apple gets a lot of flak in the InfoSec community, even though it&amp;rsquo;s an open secret that much of the InfoSec community has begun to use Apple products. I myself have been using a Mac laptop for the past ten years because they produced the first laptop I thought was worth spending money on. A lot of money.
I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Apple for more than just their products, however. I admire their stance on social issues that I care about.</description>
