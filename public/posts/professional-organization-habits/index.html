  <div class="post-content"><p>This is a topic I&rsquo;ve had a love/hate relationship with my entire life.  I was
once forced to go to a time management workshop on Saturdays in high school. My
friend and I spent more time talking to the girls in front of us than actually
listening to what the lecturer was saying, so I wonder if I missed out on
something there&hellip;  I still struggle with time management and focusing on one
task at a time until completion.  Working in an environment in which a given
task can be interrupted and superseded at any time is not doing me any favors.
This post will cover the tools I&rsquo;ve found to help me out of this situation I&rsquo;ve
found myself in.</p>
<h1 id="keepnotehttpkeepnoteorg"><a href="http://keepnote.org">KeepNote</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#keepnotehttpkeepnoteorg">#</a></h1>
<p>This tool allows you to create notebooks containing sub-folders and sub-pages.
Information is copied into a notebook primarily from text sources.  Files and
media can be copied in, but instead of in-line inclusion, KeepNote will create a
link to the content.  This is handy, so long as the location of the media or
file doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p>A caveat I&rsquo;ve found with KeepNote is that it doesn&rsquo;t alway do the best with
pasting text from a PDF.  This hasn&rsquo;t been a deal-breaker for me, but it is
something to be aware of.</p>
<p>Information is stored in a sane format on your filesystem; a notebook is a just
a folder containing the data and markup for notes in sub-folders and files.
This makes it simple to back up or copy a notebook to another system as you can
use a one-liner similar to</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ rsync -av --progress ~/<span style="color:#f92672">[</span>notebook<span style="color:#f92672">]</span>/ backup@offsite:/backups/
</code></pre></div><p>By default, KeepNote will auto-save your notebook every ten seconds, which has
saved me grief several times.  KeepNote aligns very well with the way my brain
sorts information - I find it easy to work with.  I will create a new notebook
in my truecrypt container for each engagement.  Within this notebook, I create a
new folder for each phase of the engagement.  Under each of these folders, I
create a page for each task within the phase.</p>
<p>For keeping text-based notes in a structured format, I think KeepNote is the
tool for the job.</p>

<p>Evernote took me a while to &ldquo;get into.&rdquo;  I tested it over a year ago and found
that I just couldn&rsquo;t figure out how it would benefit my day-to-day work.  I
briefly switched over to Google Keep and thought I had found a winner - Keep is
really handy for quick notes like grocery lists, and its user interface is very
attractive - but after a couple of months, I realized it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;heavy-duty&rdquo;
enough.</p>
<p>Then I met a colleague who used Evernote in a novel way.  Every variant of a
Linux command he used was kept in an Evernote.  Whenever we couldn&rsquo;t quite think
of the correct syntax, he would often pull up the Evernote faster than we would

things I do every day.</p>
