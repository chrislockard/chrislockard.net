      <title>Blacklight Privacy Tool</title>

      <guid>https://www.chrislockard.net/posts/blacklight-privacy-tool/</guid>
      <description>Today on my Mastodon feed, several folks were discussing a new tool by TheMarkup called Blacklight. This tool is billed as a &amp;ldquo;real-time website privacy inspector&amp;rdquo; that showcases the ad and tracking tech deployed by a website.
I shared this tool with several colleagues and it engendered a stimulating conversation surrounding company commitment to privacy. I argued during this conversation that it would be worse for a company to claim to value customer privacy and then have Blacklight reveal otherwise, than to have made no such claim in the first place.</description>

      <description>When my Dad turned 70, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide what to get him. He claimed to not want anything leaving me in a bind. I thought for days about what to get him and the idea I finally settled on seemed inadequate to me, but it wound up being a hit:
I presented him with a hand-written book containing 70 memories of him throughout my life. He got emotional over this gift, and for a man as stoic as he is, this was a surprise.</description>

 Hey , I found Security Vulnerability in your web application ,which can damage site as well as users too.For security purpose can we report vulnerability here,then will i get bounty bounty reward in PayPal or Bitcoin for Security bug ?</description>

      <description>Update: 2018-08-10 Shortly after writing this post, I switched to Spacemacs develop branch - cd ~/.spacemacs &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git checkout develop This upgraded my Spacemacs to version 0.300@26.1. This had the unexpected side effect of changing several of the key bindings below.
 Settinm schedules and deadlines - now require a prefix of SPC m d before entering your selection (d for deadlines, s for scheduling) Sparse trees - keybind moved to SPC m s s Archive tree - keybind moved to SPC m s A (I didn&amp;rsquo;t cover this in my original article, but this is how I archive DONE tasks) Show all TODO and deadlines - keybind moved to SPC m s s t and SPC m s s d  Introduction This is a basic overview of org-mode inside of Spacemacs.</description>

Since 2015, I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to several environments where I have seen the same basic security fails. In addition to my previous Security 101 items (2FA, avoiding password reuse, using a password manager, being mindful of what gets posted on social media, and inspecting email links) I would like to add the following new items to my &amp;ldquo;Security 101&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m so far behind the times, it&amp;rsquo;s sad. Burp Suite gained the ability to perform static analysis on JavaScript libraries back in 2014. Some sites and authors have already blogged about what their approach is for implementing this.I&amp;rsquo;d like to echo Lukas&amp;rsquo;s method, but with an easier setup.
Simply navigate to the local directory containing the app and serve it using Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in HTTP server.

      <description>The Problem Secure file sharing using AWS S3:
 I upload a file to an S3 bucket with restricted permissions The client downloads the file and processes it The client uploads the results to the S3 bucket I download the processed file and the transaction is complete  I thought setting the permissions on the bucket would be enough. I was wrong.
The Setup I use a federated login to AWS and assume a role under a corporate account.</description>

      <description>Brave, the new Firefox? I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Brave browser as my full-time web browser for two weeks now, primarily version 0.21.18. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to tell the software is not yet at version 1.0, and although I&amp;rsquo;m not ready for this to replace Vivaldi, I really want it to.
Brave is fast. Really fast. It has built-in adblocking and anti-fingerprinting technology. Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve relied on uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger for adblocking and anti-fingerprinting.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m managing a bug bounty program that has shown tremendous benefit so far. Several findings have been extremely clever, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to have good interactions with the vulnerability researchers. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve also had a few unsatisfactory interactions with researchers. This post is directed at Bug Bounty researchers that do not have much experience in corporate environments. I think a list of do&amp;rsquo;s and don&amp;rsquo;ts is appropriate for this breakdown.</description>

      <description>iOS Secure Boot Chain Each step of the startup process contains components that are cryptographically signed by Apple to ensure integrity and that proceed only after verifying the chain of trust. This includes the bootloaders, kernel, kernel extensions, and baseband firmware. This secure boot chain helps ensure that the lowest levels of software aren’t tampered with.
When an iOS device is turned on, its application processor immediately executes code from read-only memory known as the Boot ROM.</description>

      <description>Recently, work hosted an event designed to bring my team closer together. Using the Surepeople PRISM, we spent the morning discussing our dominant psychological traits and how we can use them to better interact as a team. I thought the exercise was brilliant, and it led me to seek out other tools to broaden my self awareness.
The first such tool I uncovered was the Johari Window.

      <description>Trello fascinated me upon its release in 2011. I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about my time management (lack of) skills, and Trello appeared to be my solution - it offered a sleek view of all of my outstanding tasks. Try as I might, I could not make Trello work for me. Over and over again, I would fail to use it. I just could not make myself stick with it. There was a captivating quality about Trello, however, because it was constantly mentioned in tweets, blogs, and articles.</description>

 LastPass is easier to get started with as someone who&amp;rsquo;s never used a password manager before. Their product is seamlessly &amp;gt;integrated into browsers and mobile devices, although it&amp;rsquo;s not the prettiest. LastPass stores your encrypted password vault on their servers.</description>

      <description>This morning, while I was trying to proxy traffic to this site in Burpsuite, I ran across an SSL handshake error. Googling the issue returned this helpful article that got me started on the right path. The crux of the problem was that the JRE didn&amp;rsquo;t have the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy files installed. However, since this article was published, Portswigger began bundling the JRE with Burpsuite itself.</description>

That post served as a reference for me to re-implement Letsencrypt every 90 days. Since then, my 90-day Letsencrypt certificate expired, and I was at a loss for how to re-instate it. Using my own post as a reference didn&amp;rsquo;t help me with the arcane letsencrypt errors I was encountering.</description>

      <description>I planned a post covering the Manager Feedback Cycle, but this blog post at Effective Managers covers most of what I was going to communicate.
One thing I would add to this resource, is that both managers and subordinates should strike a balance in communications frequency:
 If communications are infrequent, important details can get overlooked, and it becomes harder to resolve conflicts. If communications are too frequent, the subordinate will feel like they&amp;rsquo;re being micro-managed while the manager will feel like the subordinate can&amp;rsquo;t solve problems on their own.</description>

      <description>Apple gets a lot of flak in the InfoSec community, even though it&amp;rsquo;s an open secret that much of the InfoSec community has begun to use Apple products. I myself have been using a Mac laptop for the past ten years because they produced the first laptop I thought was worth spending money on. A lot of money.
I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Apple for more than just their products, however. I admire their stance on social issues that I care about.</description>

      <description>I had the need to proxy traffic from Burpsuite to another proxy during web app testing this week. There are a few ways to do this, but this method was the easiest since I already had Burpsuite&amp;rsquo;s TLS certificate installed. For more information on this, see the Burpsuite help. To configure an upstream proxy for Burpsuite, such as OWASP ZAP, follow these steps:
First, configure your upstream proxy that will sit between Burpsuite and the web application to listen on a different port since they both bind TCP 8080 by default.</description>

We spoke for an hour, as I described the findings to him. I corrected him when his understanding was shaky, and I confirmed where his understanding was solid. He had a development background, and was studying for a security certification, but he was managing a large security project for a well-known company and I was surprised to learn he was a security newbie.</description>

It proved to be very helpful and I&amp;rsquo;ve included it below with comments:
	# Set execution policy to allow unrestricted script scope Set-ExecutionPolicy &#39;Unrestricted&#39; -Scope CurrentUser -Confirm:$false #Create results file in current user&#39;s temp directory $results = $env:temp + &#39;\results.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Jack Daniel&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Shoulders of InfoSec Project&amp;rdquo;, this post will be focused on the people and technologies behind one of the most prevalent attacks on web sites: SQL injection.
According to OWASP, injection is the number one attack vector for web applications. Injection attacks can target many different contexts in a web application: HTML, PHP, ASP, Javascript, SQL, etc. Any context in which an interpreter parses input to execute instructions is potentially vulnerable to an injection attack.</description>
