# TL;DR - I respect your privacy
I strive for this site to respect your privacy to the fullest extent possible.

# More Info

I do not make any money from this website. I do not have any reason to track any
users of this website. I used to (see below) participate in Google Analytics to
understand how many users this site received but have since abandoned that.

The notes below outline the extent of the cookies used on this site. 

The only cookies this site should set relate to Security (DDoS prevention
via CloudFlare) and Appearance (FontAwesome resource linkage). If you notice
this isn't the case, please contact me and let me know!

**cloudflare.com**  
**2020-04-16 Update** 
See [Site Update: CloudFlare]({{ relref
"/content/2020-04-16-update-cloudflare-s3.md"}}) This site's theme loads a syntax
highlighting javascript library, highlight.js,
from cloudflare's CDN.

I strive for this site to respect your privacy to the fullest extent possible.
My only reservation about CloudFlare is that it sets the `_cfduid` cookie in
your browser. This cookie helps CloudFlare detect malicious visitors to this
website and ***does not allow cross-site tracking of visitors, does not follow
users from site to site by merging various _cfduid identifiers into a profile,
nor does it correspond to any user ID on this website**

This cookie is solely used to prevent DDoS attacks against this website. For
more information on CloudFlare's cookies, see ["Understanding the Cloudflare
Cookies"](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-Cloudflare-cfduid-cookie-do-
"Information on the cookies Cloudflare sets in the user's browser")

**google-analytics.com**  
**2020-01-22 Update:**
I have removed Google Analytics from this site. This was a long time coming. I'm
sorry that I contributed to their data hoovering, even if it was for a small
number of users.

If you find this site useful, I'd really appreciate a message on
[Mastodon!](https://fosstodon.org/@unl0ckd) If you're feeling extra generous, I'm a
[Brave Verified Creator](https://creators.brave.com/) and users of the excellent
[Brave Browser](https://creators.brave.com/) can send a small tip via the URL
bar.

**use.fontawesome.com**
The theme this site uses calls out to use.fontawesome.com to provide glyphs. I
do not know what tracking this site performs, so configure
[uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix) or [uBlock
Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) to block requests to this domain. The
usability of this site shouldn't significantly impacted.
