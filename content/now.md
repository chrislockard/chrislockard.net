Inspired by [AboutIdeasNow](https://aboutideasnow.com/), and
[NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com/about), this page lists what I'm working on
now:

* Daily listening to the [Bible In a Year](https://media.ascensionpress.com/category/ascension-podcasts/bibleinayear/)
* House training a new puppy
* Updating this website's look and feel
* Establishing a content schedule
* Distancing myself from social media by cutting my Xitter/Mastodon usage in
half
* Learning more about, and contributing to the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)
* Learning [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/) from [100 Days of
SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
* Continuing to observe and orient myself in the AI space.
* Starting a new project at [Get Unlockd](https://getunlockd.org/) to explore
faith and self-improvement topics.
