This site is a personal project of mine. I've always enjoyed writing and
sharing.

When I first got online in 1994, I realized I had discovered the best sharing
mechanism humanity had ever created. I started writing web pages using HTML and
sharing them with family, friends, and the world. This mixed my love of writing
with my love of technology.

Later, as I started my professional career, I learned from someone I esteemed
that sharing knowledge was the Hacker's Way. (RIP, Henry) And that started this
site.

Today, this site serves as a marker to show that I existed and that occasionally
I had something to say. I hope my kids find this useful one day. I hope you find
it useful, too.

## Tech Specs

Ideas for posts come from my notes that I keep in
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Apple
Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes).

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the
[PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperModtheme.) theme.

It is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

The site icon was created using [The GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/).

Posts are written from [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) in
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)), and
sometimes [Zed](https://zed.dev/).

I used [Grok](https://grok.com/) to riff on ideas for [this post about
delegation]({{% relref "2025-04-02-dont-fear-delegation.md" %}}), but have
otherwise not used AI to generate content on this site.
