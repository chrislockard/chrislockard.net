This site is a personal project of mine. I've always enjoyed writing and
sharing.

When I first got online in 1994, I realized I had discovered the best sharing
mechanism humanity had ever created. I started writing web pages using HTML and
sharing them with family, friends, and the world. This mixed my love of writing
with my love of technology.

Later, as I started my professional career, I learned from someone I esteemed
that sharing knowledge was the Hacker's Way. (RIP, Henry) And that started this
site.

Today, this site serves as a marker to show that I existed and that occasionally
I had something to say. I hope my kids find this useful one day. I hope you find
it useful, too.
