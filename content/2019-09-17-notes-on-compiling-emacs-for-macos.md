# Background

[*Skip to the notes on compiling Emacs*]({{< relref "#compiling-emacs" >}})

Since my [last post]({{< relref
 "/content/post/2019/04/16/spacemacs-cheatsheet.md">}}),
I've abandoned spacemacs in favor of building my own Emacs
environment. I've done this so that I can better learn how Emacs works
and to, hopefully, become passably proficient with [emacs
lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/
"Emacs Lisp Reference Manual ").

[Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org "Spacemacs") is a wonderful and
robust package that served to whet my appetite for discovering what
Emacs is all about. Unfortunately, it was too much for me to grok on
top of learning Emacs. For instance, I never understood what a leader
key is and why I would use that instead of M-x or SPC.

I was dealing with this frustration for nearly a year while trying to
learn two complex pieces of software at once, until I found ["Play
Emacs like and
instrument"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfZDwYeBlO4 "Play Emacs
like an instrument"). This video inspired me to dedicate the time and
effort to learn how to make the Emacs experience my own. After all,
the ability to completely customize and hack on Emacs is what
separates it from other software.

But what about all of the functionality offered by Spacemacs? Happily,
[this blog post at Bacterial
Finches](https://sam217pa.github.io/2016/08/30/how-to-make-your-own-spacemacs/
"Bacterial Finches blog") details how to capture the essence of
Spacemacs and reproduce it in a way that is my own. I used this as a
springboard to learn more about the Emacs package ecosystem, and
happily I discovered that all of my [favorite
functionality](https://github.com/chrislockard/dotfiles/blob/master/configuration.org#essentials
"Packages essential to my Emacs experience")in Spacemacs is tied to
discrete Emacs packages.

Configuring Emacs is another blog post for another day - I've already
rambled too much at this point. If you're interested, [take a look at
my emacs
configuration](https://github.com/chrislockard/dotfiles/blob/master/configuration.org#essentials
"my emacs configuration").

# Compiling Emacs

When I started this process, I was on macOS 10.14.6 with the xcode
command line tools installed, but xcode itself was not installed. It
is for this reason that the [official install
manual](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/nextstep/INSTALL
"official emacs install manual for macOS") doesn't work.

From this initial state, I ultimately had to do the following to
compile Emacs on macOS:

## Step 1 - Install XCode

I installed XCode from the App Store and then opened it so that it
could finish installation. This step was considered done once I was at
this screen:

## Step 2 - Remove and reinstall XCode command line tools

Because I was unable to locate
`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg`
as identified in the many google results for this issue, I had to
uninstall and reinstall the XCode command line tools after I installed
XCode:

`sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`

`xcode-select --install`

At this point, the macOS SDK headers installer package was placed at
`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg`

## Step 3 - Install macOS SDK headers

`open
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg`

Follow the installation to completion and you should now see the
appropriate headers  in `/usr/include`

## Step 4 - Install libxml2 and set environment variables (?)

In the haze of fixing this problem last night, this was a step I
performed, but I don't think it was ultimately required to compile
Emacs correctly.

Install libxml2 using brew:

`brew install libxml2`

Set environment variables:

`export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/pkgconfig"`

## Step 5 - Set CPATH (?)

This is another step that I don't think was ultimately required, but I
performed it none-the-less. Including here for reference.

`export
CPATH="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include"`

## Step 6 - Clone the emacs repo

Easiest step in the whole process:

`git clone https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git`

## Step 7 - Run autogen, configure, and make

With all of the prerequisites in place, it's time to configure and
make Emacs!

`cd emacs`

`./autogen.sh`

`./configure` (note that `--with-ns` is implied when run from macOS)

`make`

Test that Emacs is functioning at this point by running
`src/emacs`. If all looks good, run

`make install`

and then look in `nextstep/` for `nextstep/Emacs.app`. This can be
moved to `/Applications`, `/<User>/Applications`, or wherever else you
store binaries!
