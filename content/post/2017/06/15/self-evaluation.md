Recently, work hosted an event designed to bring my team closer together. Using
the [Surepeople PRISM][PRISM], we spent the morning discussing our dominant
psychological traits and how we can use them to better interact as a team. I
thought the exercise was brilliant, and it led me to seek out other tools to
broaden my self awareness.

The first such tool I uncovered was the [Johari Window][Johari].

{{< figure src="/images/2017/06-15-1.png" title="Johari Window" >}}

My ultimate self awareness goal is to shrink the "Blind Spot" window as much as
possible. I'm pretty sure anyone who's met me knows that my "Arena" window is
large, and probably larger than the usual person's. My fa√ßade window is
proportionately smaller.

Coincidentally, I was listening to a [rather brilliant podcast lately][jre].
Jordan Peterson mentioned during this interview a tool he was developing called
the [Self Authoring Series][SAS]. Peterson described this tool as a self-guided
psychological analysis tool to help the individual deal with past thoughts or
issues they may still be holding on to. The benefit of doing this, Peterson
claims, is that it will free the individual's mind up from holding onto these
thoughts and issues, resulting in lowered cortisol levels and an increase in
health and happiness.

I'm considering using this tool for my own purposes. I'm curious because I'd
like to know if it will help me see myself the way others see me, in the same
way that the PRISM tool helped me. Of course, a large portion of the benefit of
PRISM was that I was talking through it with several dozen coworkers. This was
performed in such a way that shrinking my Blind Spot was unavoidable.

I will continue to look for tools like PRISM and SAS, and try to separate the
wheat from the chaff as I go along.
