Alright, so it's been more than 8 years since I've started this site. (Although,
oddly, I started this site 8 years to the day before my family and I went into
quarantine due to [COVID-19][Covid]).

I like to switch things up every once-in-a-while. That's been a constant in my
life for as long as I can remember. It has the drawback of pulling my
attention in different directions. The benefit is that it allows me to stay
up-to-date in the areas of my life that matter.

Take this site: I originally envisioned I would start an InfoSec blog to rival
the likes of [Raphael Mudge][Mudge], [Bruce Schneier][Schneier] , or [Robert
Graham][Graham]. I've failed at that.

Then I thought I would write about another topic altogether, but keep my
original InfoSec topics as well. This also failed.

I say these failed because they've diluted the focus of this site and so this
site has failed to gain a following. After eight years, I've realized this isn't
a failing because I have a new purpose for this site: it's for my kids.

I want them to see what was important enough for me to dedicate the time and
effort produce content about. And so, this site will continue to be a
hodge-podge of content, but now I know this is okay, because the audience I
really want to keep will appreciate that.
