I continue [looking for work]({{< relref
"2025-12-05-preparing-to-leave-a-cherished-workplace.md" >}}) :(

- I switched back to [Firefox][1] this week after reading [this analysis][2]
  disucsing fingerprint resistance among Brave, Firefox, and Safari. ([Brave][3]
  continues to be my go-to backup, and I'm sure in a few weeks it'll become my
  default again)
- [Zed][4] version 0.219.4 released my most-anticipated feature: a
  [which-key][5] implementation. It's not perfect (the implementations in Emacs
  and Neovim are far superior) but it has potential
- [Digg][6] relaunched in public beta. Party like it's 2004!
- [How to make a damn website][7] jumped out at me this week. The instructions
  seem trivial: this is how I used to make webpages in 1995, but the basics have
  been lost to the newer generations.
