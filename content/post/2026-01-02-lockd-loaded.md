Happy New Year! 🥳

I continue [looking for work]({{< relref
"2025-12-05-preparing-to-leave-a-cherished-workplace.md" >}}) :(

- [5 Tiny Habits That Make You Instantly Magnetic][1] - A little magnetism can't hurt. 
- [Warren Buffett steps down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO after six decades] - This is a major event. I've heard Warren Buffett's name for as long as I've lived. It's unsurprising, however, as he's 95 years old. 
- [Engineering.fyi][3] - This is a nice collection of tech blogs I've only recently discovered. 
- [Run AI Models Locally: A New Laptop Era Begins][4] - The desire to run more AI at the edge is leading to a change in laptop design for the first time in more than two decades. Interestingly, Apple adapted much of these design changes six years ago with the introduction of the M1 chips. They have been behind on the AI software side, but prescient on the hardware side.
- [You're Not Burned Out. You're Existentially Starving][5] - I suspect this author, too, has reached middle age and is dealing with the corresponding identity crisis.
