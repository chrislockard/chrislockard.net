summary: "How my career is changing."
---

2019 was a busy year, both personally and professionally. 2020 is shaping up to
be another major change, especially professionally.

Ever since 2013, I've focused on the offensive side of information security,
particularly around web application penetration testing. I've strongly
identified my professional self as a "web-app pentester". For nearly a decade,
offensive security has been my focus.

Starting last year, my job responsibilities shifted toward defensive security
with a focus on security operations. This year, the shift will nearly be
complete as I will be doing little offensive security as part of my
day-to-day.

I'm bummed about this. While I believe in the mission of my employer, and I have
the fortune of working with some wonderful people, I have this nagging feeling
in the back of my mind that I'm losing a part of myself.
