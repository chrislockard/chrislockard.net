Apple gets a lot of flak in the InfoSec community, even though it's an open
secret that much of the InfoSec community has begun to use Apple products. I
myself have been using a Mac laptop for the past ten years because they produced
the first laptop I thought was worth spending money on. A lot of money.

I'm a fan of Apple for more than just their products, however. I admire their
stance on social issues that I care about.

In February 2016, a lot of press was made about the FBI wanting Apple to develop
a backdoor for the iPhone 5C used by one of the San Bernadino terrorists. The
FBI claimed it had no recourse to access data on the device during the course of
the investigation and demanded that Apple develop a backdoor to allow them to
access the device. [Apple released a letter][AppleLetter] to the general public
to give their side of events and explain why they were resisting the FBI's
request.

The letter was a gentle, yet firm, statement expressing Apple's sympathies for
the victims of the San Bernadino terror attack, but reluctance to set a
dangerous precedent about what power the Federal Government, specifically the
FBI, could impose on private American companies. There was much public backlash
over this stance by people who didn't understand the stakes. There were boycotts
of Apple products, and even a Flordia sheriff who proclaimed he would arrest Tim
Cook for failing to help in the FBI's investigation.

I believe this public backlash was the wrong, if predictable, course of action
to take. Logic abandons us in times of extreme emotion, which leads to hasty
choices being made without concern for their long-lasting effects. For as long
as I can recall, the threat of, or occurrence of, terror attacks has been the
catalyst for hastily-passed legislation amid the outcry of the population for
action.

Of course, the San Bernadino attacks were a terrible occurrence, but there were
many who leapt immediately to the emotional response of "take any action
necessary" to help the FBI. In this case, the action was to attack the
cryptography that protects communications on iPhone devices. 

Many technologists, privacy advocates, and anti-authoritarians disagreed with
the FBI's issuing of a warrant. Many proponents of the FBI's request claimed
"what harm could there possibly be if Apple created only one FBiOS for this one
device?"

What the FBI supporters failed to understand in this affair was the dangerous
precedent that would be set if Apple were kowtowed to the FBI. Law enforcement
agencies would surely jump on the bandwagon, asking Apple, and other vendors, to
create backdoors in their products to help "catch the bad guys". This slippery
slope would surely lead to the death of encrypted - and therefore private -
communications. Some may be fine with that reality, but I am not.

And, I have nothing to hide. I do, however, desire some modicum of privacy. In
Edward Snowden's words:

> Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have
> nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech
> because you have nothing to say.

I think it's important to be able to separate emotional reactions and arguments
from logical reactions and arguments when parsing news stories. This case
clearly had many emotional ties to it, but the logical response to the demands
made by the authorities should be evaluated on a personal and societal level.
The expanding of the FBIs power and the weakening of the protections built into
consumer electronics is yet another step toward enforcing a police state in the
USA as a result of terrorism. 

The following are some well-written articles (some opinionated, though I agree
with the authors' opinions) on the Apple vs FBI topic from the first quarter of
2016:
