## A 25-Year Journey

Yesterday I finished [Final Fantasy IX][wikiffix] and it felt *amazing*. The
story, music, characters, aesthetic, combat system, and itemization were great,
but that's not why it was amazing to finish this game. No, the reason it felt so
good to finish this game is because I started it *25 years ago*.

25 years is a long time. A *very* long time, actually, when one stops to review
all of the worldly, and personal, events that transpire in that time. What
nobody told me when I was younger is that 25 years doesn't *feel* like a long
time.

I distinctly remember when I started playing Final Fantasy IX, because it was
the first disc I put in my (then) brand-new PlayStation 2 console. I was beyond
ready to enjoy the experience because I had missed out on Final Fantasy VII,
widely considered one of the best games of that series, and of all time. I
wasn't going to make the same mistake twice - waiting for Nintendo to have
popular third-party titles, a situation that wouldn't be fixed until 17 years
later with the release of the Switch - so I hooked the PlayStation 2 up to the
TV, popped in Disc one of Final Fantasy IX and played.

And played. And then at some point, stopped playing. God knows why, but I
stopped playing the game part-way through, and then disengaged. For a few days
at first, and then a few weeks, then months, and before I knew it, years had
gone by. I wasn't fixated on the game, of course. It's not like I spent all of
that time thinking "oh, if only I could play." I was preoccupied. As John Lennon
famously quipped (quoting Allen Saunders), "Life is what happens to you while
you're busy making other plans". I had planned to play FFIX back in October,
2000, but then Life happened.

## The Weight of Unfinished Tasks

As Life happened, I occasionally thought about FFIX. My first reaction was
something like fondness, or nostalgia as the years went on, but the succeeding
reaction quickly followed: "I never finished that."

> I never finished that.

That's a phrase that could be applied to many of the tasks or projects I've set
out to do in my life. My journal lists a couple dozen, but I've only been
religiously keeping that journal for a bit under four years. I can think of many
hand-written ideas jotted down in Mead composition notebooks over my time.

Each idea left undone adds to my mental burden. I'm sure it does for you, too.
It's funny how this works: I don't consciously spend time thinking about all of
the work left undone - at least that I'm aware of, perhaps a background process
in my brain is constantly chewing on this - but every once in a while some event
will cue the memory of an undone task. As I get older, this happens more
frequently. As I leave things undone, this cue is followed shortly by a pang of
regret. Some of these pangs are small, but some are large and they can
negatively affect my mood for some time.

As I became a working professional, I quickly learned that I would need a system
to track the things I needed to do. [I've written]({{% relref
"2022-02-21-life-management-system-comparison.md" %}}) [about]({{% relref
"2018-08-06-spacemacs-org-mode.md" %}}) [these efforts]({{% relref
"2013-12-06-professional-organization-habits.md"%}}) here before.

But these systems all have a fatal flaw: they trick you into thinking that
planning is doing. Don't fall for it. If you're prone to procrastination like I
am, it's very easy to convince yourself that adjusting the tags on your Obsidian
notes is a productive task. "Life happens" quickly to a procrastinator.

## A Procrastinator's Plea

By all means, develop a system for task tracking. In today's world of
information overload, I would suggest a personal task tracking system is
essential. But keep it simple. Don't succumb to the desire to "build out a
system" in place of doing the work the system is supposed to track.

In brief: Do it. F&@*ing do it. Because once you do, you'll get to enjoy the
reward forever when you change "I never finished that" to "I did it."
