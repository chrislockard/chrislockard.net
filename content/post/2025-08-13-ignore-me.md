This post is just myself forcing myself to write. I have many ideas I want to
get out of my head, but it's been difficult to find the motivation to write.

We are the owners of a new Golden Retriever puppy, and he is great, but he is
also a lot of work. By the time I would sit down to think and write, I am
exhausted and just want to go to bed.

Dog owners out there: [drop me a line](mailto:blog@chrislockard.net) and let me
know how long it took before your schedule and routine was closer to normal.
