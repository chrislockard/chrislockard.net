I'm happy to showcase my new project, [**Get Unlockd**](https://getunlockd.org/)
that will be focused on exploring many of my faith-based interests.

Chrislockard.net has been a potpourri of ideas since I started it in 2012. I
wonder if a focused topic would be better. If nothing else, it's a way to
experiment with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and see how it works for me. This
site will continue to be my personal blog, but I hope to use Get Unlockd to
engage a wider audience with many high-impact ideas that I've been processing
since the Pandemic.
