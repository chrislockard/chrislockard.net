## Faith

- [Fr. Mike's Ultimate Guide to Advent][6] - 'tis the season!

## Tech

- [QuickTime turns 34!][1] - Wow. Time flies.
- [Zig Quits GitHub over Microsoft's AI Obsession][2] - Microsoft has been on a
  tear this year putting AI into everything it can. I wonder if this is the
start of a trend. (I doubt it, since the network effects of GitHub are *very*
strong right now, but who knows?)
- [Helldivers 2 Slashes Install from 154GB to 23GB][3] - I wonder how much
storage could be preserved if all games found a way to do this.

## Culture

- [Roblox: Inflated Key Metrics For Wall Street And A Pedophile Hellscape For
Kids][4] - This article terrified me. I have kids who enjoyed playing Roblox
befo my wife and I removed it earlier this year. At the time, I thought it was
temporary, but after reading this, Roblox will not be running in this house.
- [Philip K Dick's "Metz" Speech][7] - This was *fascinating*.

## InfoSec

- [Diamond Model, Kill Chain, and ATT&CK][5] - This was a good refresher on
these topics.
