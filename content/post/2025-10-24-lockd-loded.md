This week's theme was [Emacs][3] and [IRC.][2]

## Tech

- [Scripts I wrote that I use all the time][4] - I love this article because it
  shows real, usable scripts that solve real problems.
- [AI in Emacs][5] - Article on enabling AI features in Emacs.
- [What happened to Apple's Legendary Attention to Detail?][6] - An interesting
  article about how Apple has lost some of its attention to detail in recent years.
- [Meta axes 600 roles across its AI division][8] - I'm confused by this. Meta
has been offering $100m or even $1B compensation packages to AI talent. Why axe
600 roles? My cynical take is the $1b employee is going to need AI to do the
work of 600 people.

## Culture

- [Do you miss IRC and the Internet in the 90's?][7] - Yes. Yes I do.
- [Unhinged GPU box art from the early 2000s][9] - I'm also nostalgic for this
era.
- [Space Elevator][10] - This is fun!

## Faith, Religion & Inspiration

- [Prayer - GetUnlockd][1] - A post from my other site about the importance of
prayer.
- [How Countries Pray Around The World In 6 Minutes][11] - Inspiring!
