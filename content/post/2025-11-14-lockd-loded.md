## Tech

- [Firefox expands fingerprinting protections][1] - This is great to see.
   Although Brave is my daily driver, I want Firefox to succeed as well, and I
   think focusing on its core strengths like privacy is an important way forward
   for them.
- [Omarchy][2] - I've been watching Omarchy from afar. I've been impressed
  enough to install it on my System76 Thelio (Sorry, Pop_OS!) and spent a few
  hours tinkering with it. It's pleasurable, for sure, but I can't separate from
  the Apple ecosystem. The thought of migrating to Omarchy for all of my
  computing fills me with dread (what will I do for backups? How will I manage
  parental controls for my kids' devices? How will I store and sync notes,
  files, etc?)
- [Windows 11 facing intense backlash over upcoming changes][3] - Microsoft
seems to be on a roll of late, making a lot of questionable decisions. It's a
shame, too. I cut my teeth on MS DOS, Windows 3.1, 95, NT, 2000 (the best
Windows, ever), and XP before discovering Unix-like operating systems. I wish
they would reverse course, but they won't. Microsoft's ecosystem is going to be
all-AI-all-the-time (and continue being
all-telemetry-whether-you-like-it-or-not) for the foreseeable future.

## Culture

- [Washington sneaks a hemp ban into reopening the government][4] - Once again,
  the government will not debate the issue isolated, but will instead jam a law
  through without debate.
- [Ticker: Don't Die of Heart Disease][5] - Informative, if a little scary. I
signed up for [Function Health][6] at the start of the year, so I fortunately
have some data points to compare against.

## Faith

- [What does the Bible say about Fear?][7] - I'm facing a difficult season in
life and need reassurance.
