Unfortunately, I didn't arrive at the ballroom early enough to get seats, or
even standing room, to see this talk in-person:

Ed Skoudis: [How To Give The Best Pen Test Of Your Life][Skoudis]

If you're a Pen Tester, this talk is a must-see. Once you've finished that talk,
check out John Strand's [excellent follow-up talk][Strand]!

After competing for Friday night, most of Saturday, and Sunday morning, I
emerged as the 30th position (solo) out of the 120 teams competing in the CTF.
Not bad, but I want to do better!
