Grok3 is here and it's amazing. I used it to recreate a favorite game of mine
from the 1980s, "Paratrooper".

You can play it at the bottom of the post, the controls are as follows:
- Left arrow key: Move left
- Right arrow key: Move right
- "z" key: shoot
- "r" key: restart

Yes, the game is a little rough around the edges, but it's still fun to play and
the whole experience took around three minutes.

My first prompt was to Grok3 DeepSearch:

```
Write a p5js implementation of the BASIC game Paratrooper (sometimes called
paratrooper.bas or para.bas). It must be extremely polished, and I want you to
build all the sprites and assets yourself. I don't want to import any assets
```

I followed this prompt up with a Think Prompt:

```
Now create a code block with the entire correct code please
```

The future is arriving fast, and it's exciting to see how technology will
continue to shape our world. It's also important to remember that technology can
be used for good or evil, and it's up to us to ensure that it's used in a
responsible and ethical manner.
