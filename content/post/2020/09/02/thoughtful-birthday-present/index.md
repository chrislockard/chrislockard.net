When my Dad turned 70, I couldn't decide what to get him. He claimed to not want
anything leaving me in a bind. I thought for days about what to get him and the
idea I finally settled on seemed inadequate to me, but it wound up being a hit:

I presented him with a hand-written book containing 70 memories of him
throughout my life. He got emotional over this gift, and for a man as stoic as
he is, this was a surprise. It let me know I did well :smile:

This gift took me several weeks to plan and execute, so this
idea isn't for those looking to get something last-minute. It is, however, a
thoughtful gift that might be a hit in your family as well.
