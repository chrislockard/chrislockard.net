[A while back]({{< relref
"/content/post/2020/04/17/til-cloudflare-s3-security.md">}}) I described how I
secured the origin (AWS S3) of this website via bucket access policy and how
this mitigated the four threats I was concerned with. It's bothering me that I
don't have the content encrypted between AWS and Cloudflare, so this post sets
out to highlight how I've enabled that. I've found this topic to be not very
well documented, but I did find [this post][sambecker] by Sam Becker as a
resource.
 
# Refresher - Current Config

As I previously wrote, this is the current setup for this site:

{{< figure src="/images/2020/04-17-4.png" caption="" >}}

## S3

This site is stored in an s3 bucket called `www.chrislockard.net`. This bucket has
[static website hosting][awsstatic] enabled. There's a second bucket,
`chrislockard.net` that redirects to this bucket and serves requests made to the
naked `https://chrislockard.net` domain.

## CloudFlare

CloudFlare manages the DNS records for this site and its TLS settings (that is,
the encryption of traffic between your browser and the content cached on
CloudFlare).

# Enter CloudFront

[Back in 2016]({{< relref "/content/post/2016/10/03/static-sites-2016-update.md" >}})
I wrote about deploying this blog via CloudFront. I had just discovered the
awesome [AWS Certificate Manager][awsacm] and today this will
be making a return along with CloudFront to ensure that this blog is delivered
entirely via HTTPS, from source to destination. 

I am re-using the CloudFront distribution I previously created back when I
switched to using it for this site in 2016. I won't recap the process for
creating that here, see [Sam Becker's Post on Medium][sambecker] for a guide on
configuring this part. Here are some refresher notes:

* Set the CloudFront origin to the S3 website endpoint provided in the S3
  bucket's __Static website hosting__ card. This should be of the form
  `bucketname.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
* Distribution delivery method should be set to `Web`
* Distribution alternate domain names (CNAMEs) should include the naked
  `example.com` and site subdomain `www.example.com`
