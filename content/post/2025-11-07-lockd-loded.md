## Tech

- [Notion available offline][3] - This is great news for Notion users. I haven't
  used Notion in a while, but I found *tremendous* value in August Bradley's
[Pillars, Pipelines, and Vaults][4] system. I wrote more about that [here]({{% relref "post/2022-02-21-life-management-system-comparison.md" %}})

## Culture

- [Grokipedia][2] - A rival to Wikipedia that uses AI to generate articles. I'm
  not sure where this will go, but I think it's probably a good thing to have a
  challenger to Wikipedia.

## Faith, Religion & Inspiration

- [Why aren't smart people happier?][1] - An interesting secular discussion of
happiness and how it relates to intelligence. I think the answer is because
smart people might let their intelligence get in the way of their faith.
