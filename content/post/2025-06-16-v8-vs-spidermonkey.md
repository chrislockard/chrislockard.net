# [The Engine Room](https://g.co/gemini/share/efc893d5ae87)

I continue to explore Generative AI as I have been since the start of 2025.

Because I've [de-Googled]({{% relref
"/post/2020-01-22-no-more-google-analytics.md" %}}) my life to a large extent,
have so far not used any of their public models, until today.

[Gemini Flash 2.5](https://gemini.google.com/) produced excellent results while
I was researching the differences between Chromium's [V8 Engine](https://v8.dev/)
and Firefox's [SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev/) engine. I used the "Deep
Research" option and then used the "Create" button at the top to turn this
extensive report into a neat infographic.


I think the infographic does a better job conveying the analysis than I would
have in a blog post, and I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand,
genAI saved me *considerable* time. On the other, I did not develop any research
or writing skills in my pursuit of this knowledge.
