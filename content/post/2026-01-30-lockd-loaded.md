I continue [looking for work]({{< relref
"2025-12-05-preparing-to-leave-a-cherished-workplace.md" >}}) :(

- I continue to use Firefox as my default browser after two weeks. It's reliably growing on me. Privacy is near the top of my desired attributes in a web browser, and uBlock Origin's documentation explains why uBO [works best in Firefox.][1]
  - [SleepyTabs][2] is the tab management extension I felt was most lacking in the Firefox ecosystem. It's killer feature: it displays a "sleeping" placeholder tab with info about the site so I don't have to reload the site when I click a tab.
- I had [a chat][3] with chatGPT that I think is instructive. I queried chatGPT for help with a technical issue I couldn't fix on my own. I was confidently led astray over several iterations of problem solving. Eventually, the best answer for me was to perform a web search that provided a fix within minutes. I've found LLMs to be very useful, but I think we're pretty far away from AGI, and interactions like this I think validate that.
- An [internet classic][4] was making the rounds again this week.
- I worry for the "Free as in speech" future of Linux if work [like this][5] becomes the default across the ecosystem.

That's all for this week! God bless.
