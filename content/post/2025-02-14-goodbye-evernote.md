After 13 years, I deleted my Evernote account. I wish them well in rebuilding their business, because the company I work for is treading similar ground.

It's funny because I think our companies suffered from the same decline: market creation, overlong self-congratulation, lag in response to competition pivoting to novel and compelling features.

The difference between Evernote and the company I work for is they seem keen to raise prices on existing consumers instead of chasing growth with a lower barrier to entry. I'm not sure how well that's going to work for them, but I'll be cheering them on from the sidelines.
