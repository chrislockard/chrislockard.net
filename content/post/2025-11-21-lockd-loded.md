## Tech

- [Why doesn't a jet engine melt?][4] - Super cool (ba-dum-tss) explanation of
the material science behind jet engines.
- [The Little Book of C][5] - A great introduction to C programming.
- [2025-11-18 CloudFlare Outage Post-Mortem][6] - Interesting read on a recent
CloudFlare outage. There's been a lot of these recently.
- [Google Are Killing XSLT][7] - In another blow to web standards, Google is
trying to kill XSLT support in Chrome.

## Culture

- [Interactive World Atlas since 3000 BC][1] - This is super nifty, especially
as I'm close to wrapping up [BIY][2]. This clarifies the stories of the different
tribes and civilizations I've read about.
- [Fully Ramblomatic][3] - A video game reviewer I've long followed and enjoyed.
