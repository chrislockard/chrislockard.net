## Tech

- [Ghostty 1.2.2 Release Notes][1] - The latest release of Ghostty, a wonderful
terminal emulator.
- [AI and the Occult][2] - Interesting conversation about AI's roots in the
Occult.
- [US Mobile][3] - A "super" carrier I found out about from a work colleague.
Interesting plans and pricing, especially for families.(Note: I have no
affiliation with US Mobile)
- [The least amount of css for a decent looking site][4] - I'm a huge fan of
minimalism.
- [Block "Facebook" user-agents to prevent surprise bills][5] - As the admin for
  two small websites, I found this useful. CloudFlare makes this easy to do by
navigating to Security > Security Rules > Create Custom Rule.

## Culture

- [Numa Numa][6] - One of the first memes I recall seeing on the internet. I
shared this with my kids who also loved it.
