- [Claude Sonnet 4.6 Released][1] - I am all-in on the Claude train at the moment. Sonnet 4.6 has raised my expectation for other "default" frontier models. Anthropic seems to want to eliminate low-skill office work with these models. Useful? Yes. [Potentially dangerous to society?]({{% relref
"2026-02-13-something-is-happening.md" %}}) Absolutely.
- [It's Not Just You - the iOS keyboard is broken][2] - As an Apple user, I've been annoyed for a decade at how bad the keyboard on iOS is. This video is proof I'm not the only one having issues with it. 
- [FOSDEM 2025 - The Road to Mainstream Matrix][3] - I flirted with the Matrix protocol in 2019 as I was searching for a persistent alternative to IRC that wasn't Discord. I want Matrix to succeed, but I've also been curious why it hasn't seemed to take off. This video explains the trouble that project is facing.

That's all for this week! God bless.
