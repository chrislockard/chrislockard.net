Adam Shostack recently [published a great read][AdamS] on why the phrase "X is
Security 101" is a hindsight-focused and generally not very useful statement.

I completely agree with his point that people who are (or pretend to be)
security experts need to do more than flippantly make this remark when
discussing the latest security story. [I think this is part of a larger,
symptomatic issue the InfoSec community has, but I'm still formulating enough
thoughts on that to publish a post on it].

Mr. Shostack, at the (near) start of 2015, I would like to see your 101 list and
raise you mine:

* Use two-factor authentication for each online service you make use of - at
  least the critical ones

* Never reuse passwords across online services.
  
  * _Corollary:_ use a password manager like 1password, lastpass, or keepass

* Be careful what you post on Social

  * _Corollary:_ always be sure your Social Media preferences block sharing
    with anyone other than your friends

* Always inspect links in e-mails - advice I've been following since at least
  1996
