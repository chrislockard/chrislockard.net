While browsing [HackerNews,
filtered](https://tools.simonwillison.net/hacker-news-filtered) today, I came
across a post about [HTML Hobbyist](https://htmlhobbyist.com/). It struck a
deep nerve with me, as it reminded me of my early days on the web when I was just
starting to learn HTML and CSS.

For a moment, I was a teenager again, excited about what I could possibly create
and share with the world using this amazing new *World Wide Web* thing.

Now, I feel inspired to revisit how I publish my thoughts online. This site
doesn't get updated nearly as often as I would like because of the boilerplate
it requires to generate a blog post.

If nothing else, finding HTML Hobbyist today resulted in my writing this post
and that's enough for me.
