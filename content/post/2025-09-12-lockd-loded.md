These are the links that caught my attention this week. I hope you find them
useful.

## Faith, Religion, and Inspiration

- [**What does the Bible say about Equality**][7]: Worth reviewing over and
again.

- [**Read Great Books But Ditch the Guilt Trip**][9]: I need to remember this
when I feel guilty about not reading more.

- [**Overcoming Polarization in a Divided Nation Through Catholic Social
Thought**][11]: Great discussion (from 2018!) about overcoming division from
Georgetown University.

## InfoSec & Privacy

- [**Memory Integrity Enforcement**][12]: Great writeup of a new memory
protection mechanism coming to iPhone 17.

## Tech

- [**RSL Standard Licensing for AI-Generated Content**][3]: This is a big deal. I
  wonder how this will affect the use of AI in content creation.

- [**Vintage Apple Programming Books**][4]: Interesting to me because I wasn't a
  mac user until 18 years ago.

- [**Why our website looks like an operating system**][5]: I'm surprised that
after 90 seconds on this site, I don't feel uncomfortable.

- [**Wired: Perplexity is a Bullshit Machine**][10]: An interesting take on
  GenAI.

## Culture

- [**Charlie Kirk Assassinated**][1]: This horrific event is a reminder of how
  fragile society is.

- [**GetUnlockd: Political Violence in America**][2]: Some of my thoughts on
the above event.

- [**Enough: On Charlie Kirk's Murder and the Watershed Moment We Face**][6]: A
  powerful and more eloquent piece on Charlie Kirk.

- [**September 11 Attacks**][8]: If the week wasn't horrific enough, here's a
reminder of what happened 24 years ago. It's amazing how history articles and
books can describe an event, but not what it was like to experience it. I will
never forget the morning of September 11, 2001.
