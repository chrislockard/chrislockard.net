I've been working on Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI
course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) on and off for a while.

Today, I finally did a thing! I created an iOS app that I ran on my own device!

I say "finally" because I've been desiring to write a SwiftUI app for a long
time. Initially, I wanted to write an app for macOS, but decided it would be fun
to write an app I can take with me on my iPhone.

Paul's 100 Days of SwiftUI course is excellent. It's crammed full of useful
content, and although I didn't appreciate the exams at first, I now see their
usefulness. I've retained a surprising amount of SwiftUI knowledge from the
format of this course.

Kudos to Paul for creating this course and making it available for free. Thank
you, Paul!
