## InfoSec & Privacy

- [Modern iOS security features][10] - These features apply to the XNU kernel
used in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
- [Kurt got got][11] - An entertaining and incisive read about a CEO getting
phished. It can happen to anyone.

## Tech

- [HTML's Best Kept Secret][1] - Interesting article about the HTML `<output>`
tag.
- [A critique of Apple's new Liquid Glass][2] - I've heard a lot of complaints
  about liquid glass. I'm ambivalent about it, but it's interesting to read a
critique of it from a design studio.
- [I'm in Vibe coding Hell][3] - This resonates with me as someone who's never
been able to produce a useful program that was more than a few hundred lines of
code. I've been in "tutorial hell" in many languages, so I sympathize with those
in "vibe coding hell".
- [Programming types and mindsets][5] - A thoughtful article from DHH that
highlights how a person matures over time.
- [Mitchell Hashimoto describes how to vibe code well][6] - On the topic of vibe
  coding...
- [Rift - a budding tiling window manager for macOS][7] - I've used
 Amethyst on-and-off for years, but Rift looks interesting.
- [Emacs agent-shell and ACP][9] - I don't use Emacs much anymore, but I like
to check in from time to time.
- [Self-hosting email][12]: The idea of the IndieWeb and decentralization is
appealing. What stops me from implementing this is that I don't have the time!

## Culture

- [It's time to go][4] - I wasn't aware that Kahneman chose suicide.

## Faith, Religion & Inspiration

- [Wisdom from the Book of Sirach][8] - I'm journeying through the Bible in a
Year podcast, and this section of Sirach resonates with me. I wish I knew all of
this when I was 20.
