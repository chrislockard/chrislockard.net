Inspired by
[@SamuraiSakura](https://mastodon.social/@SamuraiSakura/115119744467946531)'s
Mastodon post, I'm offering some links that I found interesting these past few
weeks. I hope they inspire you or spark your curiosity!

## Faith, Religion, and Inspiration

- [**Mystical City of God - X Thread**][1]: I've heard of this book in passing, but
this thread puts it firmly in my to-read list.

- [**Alive Internet Theory**][8]: A powerful message from one of my new favorite
  creators.

## InfoSec & Privacy

- [**Boffins Build Automated Android Bug Hunting**][10]: A good use for GenAI,
methinks.

## Tech

- [**Personal site deployment - Mastodon**][2]: I'm constantly evaluating the best
method for static site hosting so discussions like these jump out at me.

- [**Which Key feature in Zed**][3]: I'm eagerly awaiting this PR to get merged
  into the [Zed][4] editor.

- [**HyperClay**][5]: This interesting project wants to make the web
read/writable as Tim Berners-Lee originally intended.

## Culture & Policy

- [**Your Phone Already Has Social Credit. We Just Lie About It**][6]: Some
difficult points to consider.

- [**Google Dodges All Remedies in Search Engine Monopoly Case**][7]: Of course
  they did. At least Mozilla still gets to keep 80% of its funding to pretend to
  fight off Big Tech.

- [**Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy**][9]: As a life-long Final Fantasy fan, this was
  priceless.
