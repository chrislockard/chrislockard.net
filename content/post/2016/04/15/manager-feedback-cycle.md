I planned a post covering the Manager Feedback Cycle, but this blog post at
[Effective Managers][EM] covers most of what I was going to communicate.

One thing I would add to this resource, is that both managers and subordinates
should strike a balance in communications frequency:

* If communications are infrequent, important details can get overlooked, and it
  becomes harder to resolve conflicts.
* If communications are too frequent, the subordinate will feel like they're
  being micro-managed while the manager will feel like the subordinate can't
  solve problems on their own.
