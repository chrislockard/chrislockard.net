Recently, I celebrated a birthday. Typically, this is a joyous time, and I have
many things to be grateful for. However, this birthday comes during a difficult
year. As my wife and I were discussing this the other day, I realized that life
can be a lot like the Atari game 'Asteroids'.

You, as the ship, must be able to re-orient and overcome challenges (blast
asteroids) frequently and rapidly. These challenges often have side effects
(asteroids' debris) that must also be overcome to truly put the challenge behind
you. As the game (your life) continues, the challenges are larger and more
frequent. Sometimes, it seems like there are so many challenges facing you, that
you lose control of the ship and start flailing around in every direction.

This has adequately described my year, during which turmoil has arisen from
deaths in both families, work uncertainty, a move several hundred miles away
from home, the challenges of raising a young child, and dealing with imposter
syndrome the whole time. My ship is spinning in all directions and the asteroids
are closing in.

All hope is not lost. I have engaged the thrusters, begun firing on every
rotation, and the asteroids are starting to break down. To be successful at the
game, you have to recognize when to confront a challenge head-on and when to
sidestep a challenge for later on. You will overcome the most immediate
challenges, but more will always be coming at you. This is not a bad thing.

You gain strength and confidence from overcoming adversity. Your skill
increases. You are faster, smarter,  agile. These are all good qualities and the
opposite of the qualities of an uncomplicated existence. When challenges
threaten to overwhelm you, remember that you will emerge not only victorious,
but harder, better, faster, and stronger.

Keep those thrusters firing!

**Update October 7, 2016:**  Exercise! Exercise is the key to giving yourself
the strength to overcome challenges. Move a little bit - every day - even if
it's only a little bit.
