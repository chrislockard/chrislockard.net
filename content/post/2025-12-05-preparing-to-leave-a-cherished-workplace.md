I've been at my current job for nearly a decade. I joined just as the company
had released its most-loved product and sales charts were hockey sticks. We were
dominant in our market, everything was on the up-and-up and the company's future
seemed limitless. I participated in weekly new-hire meetings and on-boarding
sessions, and each brought in dozens of bright-eyed new hires. It seemed like we
could do no wrong.

But oh, how the mighty have fallen.

Things started to change at the end of the pandemic. First, talk of heightened
competition in the market, followed by a questionable acquisition. I noticed
that the new CFO stopped presenting uplifting charts about company moat and the
aforementioned dominance talk stopped. There were quiet murmurs that we were
being handily outsold in Europe.

Then came the acquisition announcement. A FAANG company was going to buy us out.
Or so they said. After over a year of due diligence, the deal fell through,
ostensibly to tough regulations in Europe. But the damage was done. Morale was
battered, and then the layoffs began.

I watched as team after team was gutted. Friends were let go along with
distinguished individuals I had worked with for years. I would begin to compose
an email, only for my client to automatically inform me that the individual whom
I was addressing was no longer employed. My team was spared, so the pain was
mitigated to a degree. I didn't feel like a boiling frog, only that I was lucky
to be spared.

Now, though, barring a miraculous holiday season or other unforeseen gift, it
seems all but certain that my company will not be spared its fate.

## Emotions

My emotions are in turmoil. For months, I've tried to remain optimistic and
exude the confidence I felt when I first joined the company. But what's
surprised me more than anything is the grief.

My career up to this company involved job-hopping every few years. I never felt
like a mercenary, but I also never felt like each job I held was going to be a
lasting investment of my emotions. I fostered friendships and genuinely enjoyed
working with most of my colleagues in those years, but I was ultimately chasing
an ever-increasing paycheck.

At this company, I developed deep and meaningful relationships with my
coworkers. I've had many wonderful conversations and experiences with them. It
wasn't until the layoffs began and I lost many of these friends that I realized
how invested I had become and how pivotal this workplace was in my life.

Now, as I look around, the small fraction of people left are like me:
determined, but defeated. We work diligently to ensure that our jobs are done,
but the spark of joy is gone.

And it hurts.

It hurts because these are good people who want to do good work. It hurts
because we've survived the brutal culling of our friends and colleagues,
only to almost certainly face the same fate.

And in light of this, I begin preparations to leave.

## What Would I Tell Someone in My Position?

I've struggled with this change for months. I've been in denial for over a year,
and certainly felt anger. But it's slowly dawning on me that this is reality and
I need to be prepared to face it. So what would I tell someone in my position?

### It will be okay

First and foremost, I would tell them that it will be okay, even if it doesn't
feel that way right now. God will provide.

Being financially responsible and having a solid emergency fund makes this
advice easier to swallow, so I would advise someone to create this fund if they
can.

### There are other jobs out there

I would tell them there are other jobs out there.

It feels like this is the end of my career, but it's not. According to LinkedIn
and Indeed, there are other jobs out there that need my skills. They will
involve trade-offs, and I won't start from a position of trusted authority like
I built over the last decade, but there are opportunities.

### There are other good people out there

I would remind them there are other good people out there.

What makes me grieve the loss of this job the most is the loss of camaraderie
with my colleagues and coworkers. I hope I will always keep in touch with them,
but there are other good people out there, and I will find them.

### It will take time, but I can rebuild what I'm losing

I would tell them that, although it will take time, they can rebuild what
they're losing. It might not be exactly the same, but it can be just as good.

I came into this job performing one role. That role has changed, the job duties
have increased, and I've worked my way into being a trusted authority. It took
time to get here, and it will take time to get there again. But if I did it
once, I can do it again.

### It hurts, and that's okay

Finally, I would tell them that it's okay to grieve. It's okay to feel hurt and
loss.

I feel hurt and loss. I'm angry and I'm sad. I'm grieving.

But it's okay because these are normal human emotions to feel in this situation.
It will take time to process and heal, but I will.
