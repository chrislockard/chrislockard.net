I continue [looking for work]({{< relref

- [It's hard to justify Tahoe icons][1] - I was excited for macOS Tahoe prior to
launch, but after three months of using it, I've grown to dislike Liquid Glass
so much. This article focuses on another Tahoe UX tragedy: monochromatic menu
icons everywhere.
- [Eat Real Food: The USG's new Food Pyramid][2] - I'm old enough to remember
the 1992 food pyramid vividly.
- [New Years 2026 - GetUnlockd][3] - I hope you find this inspiring.
