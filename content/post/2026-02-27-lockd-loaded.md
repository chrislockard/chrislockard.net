- [Anthropic Drops Flagship Safety Pledge][1] - This isn't a good look for
  Anthropic.
- [Responsible Scaling Policy v3][2] - Comments from an Anthropic employee
  working on the RSP. I try not to be cynical, but this sounds a lot like "We're
  surprised that people would view the RSP as binding! We meant it to be more of
  an iterative document rather than a binding policy." I (think I) understand
  the competitive forces influencing Anthropic's decisions here, but trust is
  earned through radical transparency, not backpedaling masked as transparency.
  I hope I'm not being uncharitable.
- [What not to Write on Your Security Clearance][3] - In a previous life, I held
  a clearance. I fretted over the SF-86 and interview questions so badly as a
  youth coming out of a rambunctious high school and college phase. Stories like
  this make me realize I didn't have to worry as much as I did.
- [Why E Cores make Apple Silicon Fast][4] - Interesting analysis of macOS's
  ability to utilize the hardware in Apple Silicon.
- [Amazon's Ring and Google's Nest Unwittingly Reveal the Severity of the U.S.
  Surveillance State][5] - I haven't been very active on social media this year,
  but I'm glad that the uproar over this is as loud as it is. 
- [CyberCultural][6] - This site discusses Internet history and its effect on
  culture. For old timers like myself, this is a trip down memory lane.
- [Firefox 148 Releases with AI Killswitch][7] - This is a welcome feature for
  many. I've continued to use Firefox as my daily driver since 147 was released
  and have not returned to Brave for daily use. I'm shocked at myself.
- [Microsoft's Raymond Chen on Securing the Rights for Weezer's "Buddy Holly" to
  be on Windows 95 CD][8] - I very fondly remember going with my Dad to Costco
  (Price Club) in 1995 to buy Windows 95. We spent that night upgrading and,
  once complete, I played this video over and over again. Happy Days.
 
That's all for this week! God bless.
