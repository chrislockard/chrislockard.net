This week I fell down the Nostr rabbit hole.

## InfoSec & Privacy

- [Backlit: Did Surveillance Capitalism Predate the WWW?][13] - Interesting
research from my favorite privacy blogger, Bob Leggitt.

## Tech

- [The NOSTR Protocol: Social Media 3.0][5] - A great primer on Nostr, a
  decentralized social media protocol that I rediscovered this week.
- [Create a Nostr Profile][4] - This is the site I used to create my Nostr
profile. DO NOT EVER SHARE YOUR NOSTR PRIVATE KEY!
- [Nostr vs Bluesky: Grok Analysis][6] - I asked Grok whether Nostr or AT Proto
  (most commonly used by Bluesky) is better.
- [Are We Decentralized Yet?][7] - Mathematical measurement of online social
media concentration.
- [Primal.net][8] - A Nostr web and mobile client.
- [Damus.io][9] - A Nostr iOS and iPadOS client.
- [And Other Stuff][10] - A collective financed by Jack Dorsey to support and build
  out Nostr.
- [npub.world][11] - View of the Nostr network and profile lookup.
- [chorus.community][12] - Find Nostr communities to join.

## Culture

- [Every Noise At Once][1] - A fascinating project to map all of the world's
music genres.
- [Minds.com][3] - An independent social media platform that would benefit from
more users.
- [Where We Consume Headlines Today][2] - A study that shows how most people
only read headlines and not the full articles. This is a reminder of the
importance of critical thinking and not taking everything at face value.
