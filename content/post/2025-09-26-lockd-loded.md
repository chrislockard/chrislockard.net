These are the links that caught my attention this week. I hope you find them
useful.

## Faith, Religion, and Inspiration

- [Erika Kirk forgives the man who killed her husband][1] - Amazing.

## InfoSec & Privacy

- [LinkedIn Terms and Conditions Updating][4] - Now is a great time to review
your privacy settings if you're a LinkedIn user.

## Tech

- [Larian studios ports BGIII to Steam Deck][3] - This is remarkable not only
because this game is huge and complex, but because this port is the result of
Larian Studios backing the efforts of a single engineer who wanted a better
experience on the Steam Deck.

## Culture

- [Some of my thoughts on cultural events this week][2]
- [The First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States][5] - This week
  is a great time to review the First Amendment and consider its significance.
