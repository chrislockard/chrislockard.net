This is so long overdue, but I joined the Free Software Foundation today, and I
think [you should, too!](https://my.fsf.org/join?referrer=4933437) (Note:
clicking that link uses my FSF referral code to let the FSF know I sent you)

Their mission is to promote computer user freedom and to defend the rights of
all software users. This is a noble goal that I've always upheld morally, and
today I finally decided to uphold financially as well.

If you are in the financial position to do so, I recommend you join the FSF as
an associate and support them in their mission as well!
