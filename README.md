## 2024 March

Hugo and papermod have changed significantly in the past two years. These notes
capture how to manage this blog today.

### PaperMod Installation

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/Installation).

### Creating posts

>New posts used to be created in a year/month/day folder hierarchy. Now, they are
>all contained under /content/<postname>

These can be created using

`hugo new --kind post <name-of-post.md>`
